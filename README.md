## 📌 What is K-Nearest Neighbors?

**K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** is a simple and powerful machine learning algorithm used for **classification and regression**.  
It works by comparing new data points to the **K most similar** data points in the training set, and then making predictions based on those neighbors.  
For classification tasks, it assigns the class that is **most common among the neighbors**.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Choose the number `K` (how many neighbors to check).
2. Calculate the distance between the new data point and all points in the training data (usually Euclidean distance).
3. Pick the K nearest neighbors.
4. Use majority vote (for classification) or average (for regression) to make a prediction.
